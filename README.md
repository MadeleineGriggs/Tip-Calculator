## About this Project
this is an app for calculating the tip percentage of a total bill. It is also able to split the bill and tip between multiple people, and it is able to round the total bill to the nearest coin. The user can either select a predefined tip amount, or enter their own percentage they would like to use as a tip.

This project was created as part of the UofT Coding Bootcamp Career Services Coding Challenge. The task was to create a simple calculator for tips as either a command-line or front-end application. No boilerplate code was provided. The guidelines were as follows:

### The Application Must:
..* Take in the value of the bill.
..* Take in the desired tip percentage.
..* Include the option to split the tip amount by the number of people at the table.
..* The application should then calculate the amount of tip per table (or per person) and return that value to the user.
..* The bill value must be a positive float, but the application must handle user input that might be a negative or 0 dollar amount.
..* The user input percentage for the tip must be a positive float.
..* The return value must be a float rounded to two decimal points.

## Bonus Features
..* Create a simple UI so that this can be used in a browser.
..* Deploy to your favourite hosting service.


In addition to the features required by the challenge, I tried to implement the following:

..* Added rounding, so the user could select to round the bill total with tip to the nearest coin.
..* Made a stylish and responsive UI.
..* Adding extensive code comments to the javascript, so other people may easily understand how the calculating functions work.
..* Added CSS variables for colors and fonts, so they could be easily changed if required.


This project was written using: HTML5, CSS3, jQuery 3.4.1, and Javascript.
